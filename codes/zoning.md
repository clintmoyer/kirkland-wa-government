When a substantial development permit and a conditional use or variance permit are required for a development, the permits shall be issued concurrently. If a use is not specifically listed, then it may be considered through a shoreline conditional use permit (see Chapter 141 KZC). The following symbols apply:

### Plate 47 Establishing Average Pier Length/Navigation Line

Plate 47 is intended to clarify how the average pier length of an adjacent shoreline parcel influences the length of a proposed pier. The plate illustrates the location of several single-family piers located along the shoreline of Lake Washington. The image identifies the maximum length of 150 feet allowed under KZC 83.270(4), and the average lakeward extent of the piers along this section of the shoreline. The established line of navigation runs along the waterward side of the piers. By determining the average length of the neighboring piers, a property can identify the length of a pier that may be proposed that will be consistent with the length standards of KZC 83.270 and Shoreline Area Policy SA-11.1 in the Comprehensive Plan.

### Plate 48A How to Determine the Allowable Length of a Single-Family Pier (KZC 83.270(4))

Parcel “J” needs to establish the allowable length a pier may extend under the development regulations of KZC 83.270. Since the 150 foot measurement from the OHWM exceeds the average lakeward extent of the adjacent neighboring piers, the lesser applies. Parcel “J” may propose a pier length as shown, aligning with the average lakeward extent of the adjacent neighboring piers. The pier is subject to all other dimensional standards, including but not limited to width, area, and height.

### Plate 48B How to Determine the Maximum Length a Pier May Extend Beyond Existing Adjacent Piers (KZC 83.270(4))

An additional 10% of length on the subject property may be added based on the average lakeward extent of the existing adjacent neighboring piers. In this example, the average lakeward extent establishes an allowable length of 130 feet for the subject property. The parcel may propose up to 13.0 feet of additional length if necessary to achieve water depth
