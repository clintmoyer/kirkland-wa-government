The tax here imposed shall be in the amount of five percent on each admission charge or charge for season or series ticket. Any fraction of tax of one-half cent or more shall result in a tax of the next highest full cent.

#### 5.12.030 Cabaret, private club, and other places of entertainment.

The admission charge to any cabaret, any private club conducting cabaret activities, or any similar place of entertainment is deemed to be the total amount charged as an admission charge, a cover charge, and/or a charge made for the use of seats and tables reserved or otherwise, and other similar accommodations.

#### 5.12.050 Resort or picnic grounds.

Any person paying more than fifteen cents to gain admission to any resort or picnic grounds is subject to a tax at three percent on such admission charge even though such amount includes a charge for use of equipment and facilities such as tables, stoves and bathhouses. If a lesser amount is charged to persons who do not use such equipment and facilities than those who do use such equipment and facilities, the lesser charge is deemed the admission charge. Where a separate charge is made for the use of equipment and facilities, such charge is not subject to the tax herein levied unless it constitutes or is part of an “admission charge.” Whenever an organization or club acquires the sole right to use a resort or picnic grounds, solely for the enjoyment of its members or employees and their friends, the amount paid for such right is an amount paid for an admission charge and subject to the tax herein levied; provided, that if the organization or club in turn charges its members or employees all or part of the amount so paid, such charge does not constitute an admission charge subject to the tax herein levied. Amounts paid for the privilege of parking cars in a resort or picnic grounds do not constitute an admission charge unless the amount of such charge is determined by the number of passengers in the automobile or the same charge is made to all persons who enter the resort or grounds, whether on foot or by other means of transportation. If a charge is made for each passenger in an automobile, in addition to a charge for parking facilities, the amount paid for the passengers is an admission charge and subject to the tax herein levied.

It is unlawful for any person to sell an admission ticket or card on which the name of the person conducting the event or the price is not so printed, stamped or written, or to sell or offer to sell an admission ticket or card at a price in excess of the price printed, stamped or written thereon.

Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the director of finance and administration, but payment by check shall not relieve the one collecting the tax from liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the director of finance and administration unless the check is in the full and correct amount and until the check is honored. Any person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms and setting forth such information as the director of finance and administration may require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the director of finance and administration with a remittance for the amount; provided, that the director of finance and administration may in his or her discretion require verified annual returns from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.

Through this chapter and other ordinances of the city, the city has established an integrated and consolidated project permit process. This title is to identify the city’s system of coordinated development regulations, such as the zoning code, subdivision ordinance, Kirkland building code, and environmental procedures.

#### 20.04.120 Consistency.

The foundation for project review shall be the city’s comprehensive plan and development regulations. The city’s review of a project permit application will include determination as to whether the proposed project is consistent with applicable regulations or comprehensive plan. The determination of consistency shall be based on review of the applicable development regulations, or in the absence of a relevant development regulation, upon the comprehensive plan. The city’s review will emphasize existing requirements and adopted standards, with the use of supplemental authority as specified by Chapter 43.21C RCW to the extent that existing requirements do not adequately address a project’s specific probable adverse environmental impacts.

#### 29.04.010 Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this title is to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public by minimizing risks to life and property and ensuring that land surface modification occurs in a manner compatible with city goals for environmental protection. To preserve natural features and functions of the land until a development plan is reviewed and approved, speculative grading is discouraged. (Ord. 4151 § 3 (part), 2008)

Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of this chapter, or where the city has reasonable cause to believe that there exists upon a site a condition which is contrary to or in violation of this chapter, the city is authorized to enter the site at reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this chapter; provided, however, that such entry and enforcement shall be pursuant to a warrant or other remedy provided by law unless a public safety emergency justifies entry without a warrant or other lawful remedy.

#### 29.04.040 Inspections.

#### 29.12.030 Relationship to other regulations.

Exemption from the permit requirements of this title shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of this title or any other laws or ordinances of this jurisdiction. In particular, requests for pruning or removal of trees shall follow the procedures and comply with the standards outlined in Chapter 95 KZC. (Ord. 4151 § 3 (part), 2008)
